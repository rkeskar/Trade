## Introduction

This CRUD application is build using Laravel 6.x, PHP > 7, Vue.js, jQuery, Axios, Bootstrap. It is a single page application. I built and ran this application on Laravel Homestead. I used homestead because it provides a complete development environment.



## Description

Once you cloned the repository, go inside the project root folder and create a <b>.env</b> file there. Copy the contents of <b>.env.example</b> into it. Now you can configure your testing environment accordingly. <br><br>
Go to the project folder using command line and run the following commands <br> <b>composer install</b><br><b>npm install</b><br><br>
This will install the dependencies. <br>

With all dependencies installed, you can run the database migration. Once the migration is done, the database and tables are setup and the sample data is populated. The application is on the homepage. If you go on homepage, after data is populated, you can see the data table. There are buttons for creating new entry, updating existing entry and deleting entry.

**Note: If you go to the homepage without populating data, you will see a message asking you to do migration first.
