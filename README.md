## Introduction

This CRUD application is build using Laravel 6.x, PHP 7.4, Vue.js, jQuery, Bootstrap. I ran this application on Laravel Homestead. Homestead provides
a complete development environment so there is no need to individually install apache or nginx, php, etc.,
Besides, npm package manager is used.



## Installation Steps

 I have created the required tables for this application. You would have to run the migration and then the tables and the data will get
 populated. Once the data is installed, the application runs.
 
 The routes are defined in the application and they navigate accordingly.
