## Introduction

This CRUD application is build using Laravel 6.x, PHP > 7, Vue.js, jQuery, Axios, Bootstrap. I built and ran this application on Laravel Homestead. Homestead provides
a complete development environment. You can see composer.json file for more details.



## Description

To get started, you would have to run the database migration. Once the migration is done, the database and tables are setup and the sample data is populated. The application is on the homepage. If you go on homepage, after data is populated, you can see the data table. There are buttons for creating new entry, updating existing entry and deleting entry.

**Note: If you go to the homepage without populating data, you will see a message asking you to do migration first.
